Guess the word

Define an array with several words to guess
Initialize a random seed for random operations
Select a random word from the array
Set up a game loop:
    Display the word with guessed letters and placeholders for unguessed letters
    Ask the user to guess a letter or the entire word
    If the user guesses a letter correctly, reveal it in the word
    If the user guesses the entire word correctly, congratulate them
    If the user runs out of attempts or guesses incorrectly, end the game
